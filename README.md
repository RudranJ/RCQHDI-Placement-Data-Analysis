# RCQHDI-Placement-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on the epidemiological analysis of HIV and Viral Hepatitis data for the Republican Centre for Quarantine and Highly Dangerous Infections (RCQHDI) under the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Project Aim:
To transform a large, fragmented, and raw dataset of patient records into a clean, standardized, and analytically-ready asset. The ultimate goal is to produce actionable insights through visualization and statistical analysis to inform public health policy and strategic decision-making.

Methodology:
The project follows a two-part methodology:

Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python): Using Python with the pandas library, a robust cleaning pipeline was developed to address real-world data challenges. This included debugging complex encoding errors, translating hundreds of Russian/Kyrillic column headers and values, and standardizing data types across a dataset of over 7,000 patient records.

Visualization & Statistical Analysis (Power BI & Python): The cleaned data was used to create an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key epidemiological trends. Further statistical analysis in Python was conducted to test for associations and correlations between key clinical and demographic variables.

Key Contributions:

Definitive Master Dataset: Produced a final, perfectly cleaned and translated master dataset of 7,182 patient records with 175 standardized columns.

Actionable Insights: Developed a comprehensive dashboard and statistical report to highlight key findings on co-infection burden, diagnosis stages, transmission routes, and other critical public health indicators.

Open & Reproducible Science: All code and key non-sensitive files are managed and version-controlled using this GitHub repository, ensuring the work is transparent and can be easily reproduced.
